In this update, I added the following features: 
- You can now press Tab to move between TextInputs. 
- I have disabled all unnesscary TextInputs. You would notice these as areas a bit grayer than the normal ones.
- Warning Windows will have a more uniform message with a proper name as a Window name.

Also, I have fixed some minor bugs:
- Filling zero into the temperature input will now trigger a Warning Window.
- Filling only a "." in the temperature input will now trigger a Warning Window.
