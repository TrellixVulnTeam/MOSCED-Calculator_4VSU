This is a MOSCED Calculator App built using Python and Kivy. In this project, I have added 3 main features to help you do MOSCED Calcultions in the most convinient way, and will definitely continue to develop it in the future. In this current version of the code, I used these two refereces as data:

1) Lazzaroni, M. J., Bush, D., Eckert, C. A., Frank, T. C., Gupta, S., &amp; Olson, J. D. (2005). Revision of MOSCED Parameters and Extension to Solid Solubility Calculations. Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research, 44(11), 4075-4083. doi:10.1021/ie049122g		
2) Dhakal, P., &amp; Paluch, A. S. (2018). Assessment and Revision of the MOSCED Parameters for Water: Application to Limiting Activity Coefficients and Binary Liquidâ€“Liquid Equilibrium. Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry Research, 57(5), 1689-1695. doi:10.1021/acs.iecr.7b04133

In order to have the best experience, please use the app in full screen mode since minimize it might cause word lines to be overlaped.

Also, since I am not able to require citation or acknowledgment in research papers which use the GPL-covered software or its output, giving our research teams and I credits is completely optional to you. However, please consider doing so whenever you use our project since it did consume us a huge amount of time and effort.
